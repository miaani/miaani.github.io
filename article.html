    <p class=title> What Influences National Happiness?  </p>

    <p><span class="leader"> Does Money buy you happiness?  </span> </p>
    
    <p>Over the last 50 years economists, philosophers and psychologists have completed many studies into the power of money on our wellbeing. In Richard Easterlin’s seminal work “Does money buy happiness?” he found that in many countries “there is a clear indication that income and happiness are positively associated” (page 99) (Easterlin, 1973) and more recent analysis of a total of 335 studies revealed that there is a mean income to happiness correlation value of 0.23. The link therefore between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which is used by countries to measure the monetary value of final goods and services produced, and a nation’s happiness levels must be equally as strong or is there “more to life” than money?  </p>

     <p> Since the 1960s GDP per capita has risen dramatically in the United Kingdom.  Figure One shows how in comparison to other countries the UK has seen strong sustained increases in GDP per capita in the last 50 years. However, surveys from the Office of National Statistics do not show any evidence that national happiness and wellbeing levels are increasing in similar patterns. Over the last few years since the COVID-19 pandemic people are less happy on average (Booth & Goodier 2023). This conflict in patterns indicates therefore that there are other factors at play in determining a country's happiness. </p>
    
     <p> When looking at the data for the happiest nations worldwide it is easy to see that there are not only differences in happiness levels between the rich and the poor countries but that there are also stark differences in the happiness levels between rich economies. A key example of this difference is between the happiness levels of France and Finland. An article published by Gael Brule and Ruut Veenhoven highlights the reason why the Finns are much happier than the French is actually somewhat down to perceived freedom (Brule and Veenhoven 2014). The dashboard below shows the correlation between various indexes of freedoms including political freedom.  The satisfaction with life index shows how they all have strong positive relationships indicating that freedom is actually a key driving factor behind a nation's happiness.

    <p><span class="leader"> Environmental Factors</span> </p>
    
     <p> Do the neighborhoods we live in affect our happiness? The areas that we live in can also have a significant impact on our happiness levels.  Data from the European Commission and Gallup shows that on average people living in cities are happier than those who live in the rural countryside. They found these differences in happiness levels to be partially down to the impact of social circles as people who live in cities are more likely to be closer to people who they can rely on and socialise with regularly (Djikstra, Papadimitriou & Nichols 2020). However, happiness scores also differ between areas and neighbourhoods within cities like London and one of the main factors that creates these differences across cities is poverty rates. Areas with higher poverty rates are on average more likely to be unhappy as financial stress and unemployment can have significant impacts on wellbeing and mental health. Areas with higher poverty and deprivation rates also experience higher crime rates on average, as illustrated by the figure below which shows this relationship as well as mapping total crime rates for each London Borough. The figure also shows the relationship between the total number of crimes and the average happiness score in each London Borough illustrating how as crime rate increases the average happiness score is on average lower.  </p>

    <p>New research from the European Centre for Environment (Mizen et al., 2019) and Human Health using 18 years of data from over 10,000 participants has revealed the positive relationship between access the green space and mental health showing the way people interact with their outside environment can lead to a range of favourable outcomes. These impacts have been shown to not only improve the mental health and happiness of people but also improve physical health with this change being particularly evident in children. These positive relationships therefore, provide considerable evidence to argue that happiness levels are not only impacted by economical factors but also environmental factors as well. The figures below show the percentage green and blue coverage of the different London Boroughs. </p>
